# Using the Mask

This assumes you have already run through the sample in the
[README](./README.md). And have an initialized account. You can use any connect
method (sharing with cli, customize blockchain) if you want. We will show
uploading mask and using it on the Demo Net.

Start with `./bin/cosmjs-cli --init examples/helpers.ts examples/mask.ts` (note
the addition of `examples/mask.ts`)

## Setup

Ensure the account is set up:

```ts
// you can hand-copy a mnemonic here, but this is easiest for reuse between sessions
// it creates a random one first time, then reads it in the future
const mnemonic = loadOrCreateMnemonic("foo.key");
const { address, client } = await connect(mnemonic, {});
address;
client.getAccount();
```

We will use
[mask v0.1.0](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-examples/tree/mask-0.1.0/mask),
the hash is
[defined here](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-examples/blob/mask-0.1.0/mask/hash.txt):
`1f50bbff503fd9c7bfe713bbf42b309cf88ef299fa76e0242051c9a7e25649a3`. The
following will check if it is already uploaded:

```ts
const hash = "1f50bbff503fd9c7bfe713bbf42b309cf88ef299fa76e0242051c9a7e25649a3";
client.getCodes().then((codes) => codes.filter((x) => x.checksum === hash));
```

If it is not uploaded, we will upload it:

```ts
// Either download the code
const wasmUrl =
  "https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-examples/blob/mask-0.1.0/mask/contract.wasm?raw=true";
const wasm = await downloadWasm(wasmUrl);

// Or load from local file
const wasmFile = ".../cosmwasm-examples/mask/contract.wasm";
const wasm = fs.readFileSync(wasmFile);

// Then upload it
const up = await client.upload(wasm, {
  source: "https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/cw-mask/0.1.0/download",
  builder: "confio/cosmwasm-opt:0.7.3",
});
up;
up.logs[0].events[0];
```

Now, make an instance (as above):

```ts
// get the proper codeId
const codes = await client.getCodes();
const codeId = codes.filter((x) => x.checksum === hash).map((x) => x.id)[0];

// instantiate one contract
const maskResp = await client.instantiate(codeId, {}, "My Mask");
const mask = maskResp.contractAddress;

// You can also find the contractAddress later (in a future session), like:
const contracts = await client.getContracts(codeId);
const mask = contracts
  .filter((x) => x.label == "My Mask")
  .map((x) => x.address)[0];
```

Now, let's use the mask. To do so, we need to load it up with some tokens (both
native and ERC20 - from the contract you deployed last time).

```ts
client.sendTokens(mask, [{ amount: "500000", denom: "ucosm" }]);
client.getAccount(mask);

// get the foo contract again...
const ercId = 1; // from earlier example, change this if different on your network
const ercs = await client.getContracts(ercId);
const foo = ercs.filter((x) => x.label == "FOO").map((x) => x.address)[0];

// send some erc tokens to the mask as before
client.queryContractSmart(foo, { balance: { address: mask } });
const ercMsg = { transfer: { recipient: mask, amount: "800000" } };
client.execute(foo, ercMsg);
client.queryContractSmart(foo, { balance: { address: mask } });
```

## Usage

### Sending Native Tokens

Now, let's send some tokens from it:

```ts
const rand = await randomAddress("cosmos");
client.getAccount(rand);
client.getAccount(mask);

const callSend: HandleMsg = {
  reflectmsg: {
    msgs: [sendMsg(mask, rand, [{ amount: "80000", denom: "ucosm" }])],
  },
};
client.execute(mask, callSend);
client.getAccount(rand);
client.getAccount(mask);
```

### Sending "ERC20" Tokens

And call the ERC20 contract from it:

```ts
client.queryContractSmart(foo, { balance: { address: rand } });
client.queryContractSmart(foo, { balance: { address: mask } });

const callContract: HandleMsg = {
  reflectmsg: {
    msgs: [
      contractMsg(foo, { transfer: { amount: "80000", recipient: rand } }),
    ],
  },
};
client.execute(mask, callContract);
client.queryContractSmart(foo, { balance: { address: rand } });
client.queryContractSmart(foo, { balance: { address: mask } });
```

### Staking via OpaqueMsg

And now... let's use `OpaqueMsg` to call into native blockchain messages. Here
we will trigger a staking command. This is an "opaque" command, so neither
cosmwams-js nor the cosmwasm contract understands it. It is passed verbatim from
the client to the wasmd blockchain (reflected by mask, so using the mask
address).

To view this properly, we will have to use the cli tooling:

```sh
wasmcli config node https://rpc.demo-071.cosmwasm.com:443
wasmcli config trust-node true

wasmcli query staking validators
wasmcli query staking delegations-to cosmosvaloper1e8gslcu2u2p5zp9rgj8alz4q3lt6hvywqppf23

# create a demo tx to show how it looks
wasmcli tx staking delegate cosmosvaloper1e8gslcu2u2p5zp9rgj8alz4q3lt6hvywqppf23 300000ustake --generate-only --chain-id testing
```

To create such a message, we need to produce the amino json encoding of a
staking message. That does involve a bit of investigation, but looks like:

```json
{
  "type": "cosmos-sdk/MsgDelegate",
  "value": {
    "delegator_address": "",
    "validator_address": "cosmosvaloper1e8gslcu2u2p5zp9rgj8alz4q3lt6hvywqppf23",
    "amount": {
      "denom": "ustake",
      "amount": "300000"
    }
  }
}
```

Run the following (taking the operator address for the validator from the cli
output)

```ts
mask
address

// get some staking tokens for the mask
hitFaucet(defaultFaucetUrl, mask, "STAKE")
client.getAccount(mask)

.editor
const staking2 = {
  type: "cosmos-sdk/MsgDelegate",
  value: {
    delegator_address: mask,
    validator_address: "cosmosvaloper1e8gslcu2u2p5zp9rgj8alz4q3lt6hvywqppf23",
    amount: {
      denom: "ustake",
      amount: "300000"
    }
  }
};
^D

const callOpaque2: HandleMsg = { reflectmsg: { msgs: [opaqueMsg(staking2)]}};
client.execute(mask, callOpaque2)

// Note: currently this returns an error about "Event type must be one of message, transfer, wasm; got delegate"
// That is on the client parsing the logs on success. Don't worry, it will be fixed soon.
// https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/157
```

Now validate this with the CLI tooling:

```sh
wasmcli query staking delegations-to cosmosvaloper1e8gslcu2u2p5zp9rgj8alz4q3lt6hvywqppf23

// use the address from node repl
wasmcli query staking delegations <mask address>
```

The opaqueMsg style is a bit more tricky as it places the burden of transaction
construction upon the user (you). However, it does allow you to call into any
native module in the blockchain. We plan to add custom types for some popular
native messages to make this binding simpler, and also allow these to be
triggered by internal contract logic (they cannot form opaque messages, but
rather just relay opaque messages formed by the clients).

## Transfering Owner

Happy hacking using the mask contract. And to make this a bit more interesting,
note that you can transfer control of this mask. By transfering ownership, we
transfer control of our `ucosm` native , our `FOO` erc20 token, and our open
staking position in one fell swoop, without the other modules/contracts being
aware of the change.

```ts
const aliceMnem = loadOrCreateMnemonic("other.key");
const { address: alice, client: aliceClient } = await connect(aliceMnem, {});
alice;

client.getAccount();
aliceClient.getAccount();

// send some minimal tokens
client.sendTokens(alice, [{ amount: "500000", denom: "ucosm" }]);
aliceClient.getAccount();

// now, transfer ownership of the mask
const query: QueryMsg = { owner: {} };
client.queryContractSmart(mask, query);
const transferMsg: HandleMsg = { changeowner: { owner: alice } };
client.execute(mask, transferMsg);
client.queryContractSmart(mask, query);
```

From now own, alice can control the mask, not me.... And she can extract the
erc20 tokens or anything else the mask controls

```ts
client.queryContractSmart(foo, { balance: { address: alice } });

const withdraw: HandleMsg = {
  reflectmsg: {
    msgs: [
      contractMsg(foo, { transfer: { amount: "80000", recipient: alice } }),
    ],
  },
};
// this will error (me)
client.execute(mask, withdraw);
// this will succeed (alice)
aliceClient.execute(mask, withdraw);
client.queryContractSmart(foo, { balance: { address: alice } });
```

Please explore the use-cases of the Mask. More than a production-ready contract
(which it may be), it is designed to be a tool for devs to explore the potential
of composition and re-dispatching messages. See what you can do here, then use
this knowledge to build your own contract that calls other contracts. This is
working today, you just have to return the right messages from `handle`.
